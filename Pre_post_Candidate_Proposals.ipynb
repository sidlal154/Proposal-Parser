Villa Nouns aims to be the ultimate destination for Nouns fans and newcomers alike, a place that blurs the line between onchain and offchain.\\nMore than a place to stay, our goal is to create a highly curated, customisable, Nouns-themed venue open to all. By encouraging innovation, art, education and fun experiences, Villa Nouns will reflect the Nouns values and ethos in the real world, while meeting the growing demand for immersive experiences inside and outside of the Nouns community.\\nHow it works\\nBook\\nyour stay on Airbnb, or onchain from villanouns.wtf.\\nAccess\\nthe villa with your wallet, and share access with others onchain. No physical keys needed.\\nExplore\\nthe spaces to discover and interact with the Nouns universe.\\nBuy\\nnounish furniture, items or NFTs directly at the villa, with your Ethereum wallet.\\nRevenue generated from bookings and sales of nounish items will be partly channeled back into the Nouns treasury, as well as shared with partnering communities and Nouns owners.\\nTimeline\\nWe plan to complete all work in 12 to 24 weeks and start welcoming guests by 2024.\\nTeam\\nManagement\\n: Led by the villa owner, an experienced property developer.\\nDevelopment\\n: Carried out by dlabs, known for working on projects like Nouns Agora, Optimism, Slice and Juicebox.\\nDesign and art\\n: Made by skilled architects, designers and artists.\\nCommunity\\n: Nouns owners and communities will be able to partner up with us and become sponsors of the project, further customising the spaces at the villa.\\nFunding request\\nWe request 121 ETH to give the villa a nounish makeover, cover operational expenses for 1 year, as well as ensure guests have a highly curated experience.\\nThe villa in its present state is already a sought-after location in the area. Renovating it will only add to its popularity, so execution risks are minimal.\\nThe primary goal of this project is to explore the potential of a nounish vacation destination, gauging both demand and impact, while keeping risks and costs low for the DAO.\\nThe villa will stay Nouns-themed for at least 2 years, and possibly indefinitely. This fact together with the growth potential and the future plans outlined below further help justifying the expense.\\nFuture plans\\nThe proposal aims to fund the redesign of the villa and cover operational costs, but our commitment doesn\\u2019t stop there. In the coming months we\\u2019ll explore the following areas, either autonomously or with further support from the DAO:\\nNounish home goods\\n: In collaboration with artists and designers, we\\u2019ll craft a line of items and furniture inspired by Nouns. They'll first appear at Villa Nouns and then will be available for everyone to buy, helping to proliferate the Nouns vibe far and wide.\\nActivities for everyone\\n: We\\u2019ll offer a range of activities to enhance the guest experience further. Think pools, sports areas, dining spots, and curated outdoor adventures for kids and adults.\\nBuilders retreats\\n: During the low-season we plan to host artists, hackers, and creators to brainstorm and build on nounish ideas, free of charge. Leveraging Prop House for the selection process, Villa Nouns will be temporarily turned into a hub sparking innovative projects and fostering connections in the Nouns ecosystem.\\nMore spaces, more stories\\n: We plan to open more properties locally and around the world, especially in places rich in art and culture. It\\u2019s not just about expanding \\u2014 it's about building a global community that shares the Nouns spirit.\\nFranchise model as a public good\\n: Keeping in line with the CC0 spirit, we\\u2019ll be opening doors for property owners to become part of Villa Nouns, while ensuring quality through a rigorous review by our team.\\nDecentralized ownership\\n: If the concept proves successful and Nouns DAO wishes to double down on the initiative, it will be possible for the DAO to own or co-own the estate.\\nThe nounish experience\\nReferences to many past and future Nouns projects will be integrated with the interiors of the villa and the surrounding natural environment.\\nGuests will be able to read the Nouns comic, ride Gnars skateboards or surfboards, watch the Nouns movie, learn the history of Nouns, and more. Furthermore, holders of Nouns and derivatives will enjoy an even more personalised experience, customising screens and interiors of the villa based on their NFT holdings.\\nCertain areas of the house like the bedrooms will be themed on specific Nouns or derivative collections. The overall experience will also evolve over time due to feedback and new projects in the Nouns ecosystem.\\nMost items at the villa will be Nouns themed, like towels, cutlery and home accessories, and some will also be gifted to guests. Among the nounish objects, furniture and decorations, we also plan to build suggestive stone mosaics and murals made by artists in the Nouns community.\\nBooking and entering the villa\\nGuests will be able to book the villa on Airbnb, or directly onchain through a custom booking website on\\nvillanouns.wtf\\n.\\nThe villa can be accessed by connecting the wallet on-site and verifying the purchase. Other wallets can also be appointed by the buyer to unlock the villa using delegate.cash.\\nThe villa and location\\nVilla Nouns is an elegant villa located in Sardinia offering stunning views over the La Maddalena Archipelago, one of Italy's most coveted tourist destinations.\\nThe spacious interior is designed for relaxation and focus, while the outdoor patio and large private garden are perfect for enjoying al fresco dining, relaxing in the Jacuzzi, or immersing in nature.\\nThe villa includes a large living room with a sofa bed, four bedrooms (three with queen beds, two of which have en-suite bathrooms, and one with twin beds), and three bathrooms with hydromassage showers.\\nFeatures a 1250 sqm garden, a heated four-person Jacuzzi, high-speed Starlink internet connection, heating and air conditioning, and private parking for up to two cars.\\nThe location\\nThe villa is located in the heart of Costa Smeralda between the picturesque port town Palau and the popular spot Roccia dell\\u2019Orso. Its prime location provides easy access to beautiful beaches and renowned attractions.\\nThe spectacular Maddalena islands, are just a short boat ride away, while the prestigious Porto Cervo and Porto Rotondo are conveniently close, making it the perfect location to enjoy the most evocative places Sardinia has to offer.\\nSee more on\\nvillanouns.wtf/gallery\\nFinancial aspects\\nThe villa has been rented out for several years, with rates between $50 and $110 per person per night based on the season. This generated on average $60k of revenues a year, mainly during summer.\\nBy renovating the villa we expect an increase in demand and in turn revenues and prices \\u2014 especially during summer. During the low season, the villa may also be repurposed for events and host other activities related to Nouns, allowing experimentation in coordination with the DAO and the exploration of alternative revenue models.\\nRoadmap\\nOctober 2023 - December 2023\\nVilla Nouns refurbishment and redesign\\nDevelopment of website and on-chain booking experience\\nFrom January 2024\\nOpen bookings at\\nvillanouns.wtf\\nand start welcoming guests\\nFunding request\\nVilla redesign and refurbishment - 71 ETH\\n[Renovation] Allocate 45 ETH to upgrade the villa's interior and exterior to incorporate Nouns-themed objects, decorations, furniture, NFT displays, and other technologies to make the guests experience unique.\\n[Professional services] Architects, interior designers and artists involved in the redesign process\\n[Onchain lock and interactive experience] Make a smart lock which allows access based on onchain bookings, as well as develop and fine-tune the interactive experience at the villa.\\nDevelopment - 28 ETH\\n[Website and contracts integration] Build the\\nvillanouns.wtf\\nplatform, with an innovative onchain booking experience.\\nMarketing and operational costs - 22 ETH\\nCreate material to promote Villa Nouns as the ultimate nounish destination, such as drone and showcase videos, and professional photo shoots.\\nAll operational and management costs involved in bringing Villa Nouns to fruition.\\nTotal ask: 121 ETH\\nPS.

        "        \"Description\": \"Description\\nPLEASE NOTE, THIS PROPOSAL WAS UPDATED FOLLOWING A COMMENT AROUND ADDING MORE LEGAL CLARITY TO THE PROCESS + EXPLAIN HOW NON-KYCd MEMBERS CAN SELL THEIR OWNERSHIP RIGHTS\\nNounsDAO is among one of the most prominent communities and ecosystems in web3. For the last couple years, Nouns has led the charge on a new way for projects and ideas to get funded. Over this time, the vast majority of funding was issued with few strings attached or promise of financial returns - instead, focusing on funding things the community wants to see happen in the world.\\nThis proposal is an experiment to break ground on a new kind of proposal: one that has the potential to provide perks to Nouns holders, and that has the potential to generate financial returns on deployed capital to ultimately increase demand for Nouns NFTs.\\nSome background on Venture Club\\nVenture Club is a web2.5 project that has been building legal infrastructure to democratize capital formation over the last 1.5 years. Our core focus is on taking offchain assets (such as equity, SAFEs, SAFTs, Income sharing agreements, real estate, etc), and moving them compliantly onchain as NFTs, in different UIs. The NFTs created are DeFi compatible between KYCd addresses and allow-listed smart contracts.\\nYou can see some of the assets we\\u2019ve minted onchain\\nhere\\n.\\nOur proposal is a proof of concept, to demonstrate the ability of Nouns DAOs to participate in the purchase of traditional real world assets. We believe this option will open up new use cases for NounsDAOs, which have not yet been possible before.\\nWhy should you care?\\nHaving a clear and tested process to acquire \\u201creal world\\u201d assets has the potential to benefit current and future Nouns members. The main reasons why this should be of interest are:\\nProvide perks to members. For example, a piece of real estate could be purchased, and access could be given to Nouns members. Or rental income could be shared with Nouns members. Having access to these sort of assets most definitely helps propagate the Nouns meme, while simultaneously providing a very tangible benefit.\\nProvide Nouns holders a means to benefit financially from teams and startups they support via the DAO.\\nA Proof of Concept\\nThis proposal is a proof of concept (POC), to demonstrate that 1. NounsDAO can deploy capital to purchase an offchain asset; and that 2. ownership of this offchain asset can be claimed compliantly by its NounsDAO members.\\nThis POC aims to demonstrate this concept via the purchase of an ownership stake in Venture Club, who has built the technology to make these offchain purchases possible.\\nOur hope is that this model can be used in the future by NounsDAO to invest and acquire a variety of new asset classes which has not been possible until now (to our knowledge, a few projects have tried, but none have been able to provide a clear / compliant path forward).\\nBy proving this model out, it may even be possible that we see an increased demand for Nouns NFTs from speculators looking for exposure to assets and opportunities only available to this community.\\nThe end result is a NounsDAO with\\nan increased number of options\\nin front of it. Options to engage, options to reward, options to monetize and attract - in order to create a more desirable community to be a part of.\\nOur proposal\\nWe are asking the NounsDAO community to make a strategic 50 ETH investment in Venture Club (via a SAFE investment agreement).\\nOwnership in the investment will be split between all Nouns members who claim their personal ownership in the SAFE via the Venture Club app.\\nPayment for proportional ownership in the SAFE will be made in a fresh ERC20 token that will be airdropped to all Nouns holders. This is a utility token, used as payment only.\\nAs a US based company focused on tokenization of securities, Venture Club takes compliance seriously. Only KYCd individuals will be able to claim ownership in the SAFE. In addition, unaccredited US investors will not be able to participate.\\nFor individuals who don\\u2019t meet these criteria, they will be able to sell their ERC20 payment token for their portion of the SAFE using P2P tools like airswap. Venture Club will help facilitate this process via our Discord.\\nAs part of the Venture Club tokenization process, it is possible to set carry fee (currently 1%), as well as royalty fees (currently 5%) on secondary sales of NFTs. In order to incentivize the sponsoring of this proposal, fees arising from this proposal will be shared equally between Venture Club and those who sponsor this proposal.\\nMilestones and next steps / sequence of events\\nOnce this proposal is approved, a deal page will be published on Venture Club\\nA Discord channel will be created in the Venture Club Discord to provide any support\\nNouns holders will be able to access the opportunity on our app, and mint their respective share of the SAFE contract via an NFT\\nOnce this proof of concept is complete, we would like to work with other teams looking to provide tangible benefits to Nouns holders.\\nWe will timebox the duration to 2 months after the proposal passing to claim ownership rights.\\nSome additional information\\nSome of our investors:\\nGabby\\n(Founder of YGG),\\nTimour\\n(Seed Club),\\nMetaCartel Ventures\\n(first venture dao in web3), Evgeny (founder of\\nRe7\\n), Ben Middleton (founding partner at\\nAscensive Assets\\n),\\nCultur3 Capital\\n(web3 focused fund), among others\\nOur\\nslide deck\\n(pw:Seed23)\\nOur app:\\napp.ventureclub.club\\n(note, we\\u2019ve created a group for Nouns which you can join on the Network tab.

Let's design a keyboard a Nouns-themed Mechanical Keyboard (MK) that the community appreciates! NextMech and I are excited to bring this project to Nouns in collaboration with top-tier keyboard designers. With our internal MK knowledge and technical ability we plan to introduce the MK community to Nouns.\\nOverview\\nOver the years,\\nan online subculture (reflected in partial MK ecosystem stats)\\nhas evolved, valuing custom keyboards as art pieces. This MK enthusiast community operates similarly to NFT communities. For instance, designers unveil their plans to collectors, who pre-order to finance manufacturing costs. The communities, decentralized across various platforms and websites, foster a rich dialogue between designers and fans.\\nThey even organize global meetups\\n. There's potential to gradually unify these communities to enhance the experiences.\\n[SF meet March 5th, 2023 with photoshopped Nouns mk -\\noriginal photo\\n]\\nThe community activity and other meetups can be seen by searching for\\n\\\"mechanical keyboard meet\\\"\\non Twitter/X or searching \\\"\\ncustom keyboard\\n\\u201d on Instagram. This culture also extends into the gaming/work setups online.\\nAlso, looking at the r/MechanicalKeyboards subreddit we see the community is slowly growing over time:\\nHere is a small data set that we have gathered on the ecosystem to provide more context.\\nUs\\nNextMech and I (profish) began working on a project called Mechies last year which won a small prize in an Aussie hackathon. We thought about MK NFTs in different forms such as generative art with manufacturable traits, DAOs as Vendors for group buys, hardware-embedded signatures, etc., to help improve the ecosystem. But at the beginning of the year, we learned about Nouns and saw the potential for consumer-good NFTs. So we thought it would be interesting to run this experiment with the most vibrant NFT community.\\nWe devised a proposal in April (\\nprop #266\\n) with an ambitious plan. We listened to the feedback and created this revision. However, due to the uncertainty surrounding the fork, we delayed the initiative to observe the outcome and find a better time for our own schedules.\\nNouns x MKs\\nThe proliferation can take immediate effect with current channels. For instance, the Nouns Esports team can incorporate keycaps into their gaming setup (without affecting functionality), showcasing to the gaming spectators. Nouns keycaps may serve as POAPs for crypto conference and hackathon participants, while the full Nouns keyboards are taken to global meetups. Furthermore, images of these keyboards and keycaps will appear on popular online forums and social media accounts of MK enthusiasts - the design is not going to be as blatant as the one you see, but rather more aesthetic and nuanced in appearance. Also, we plan to work with MK builders and reviewers who have hundreds of thousands, even millions of followers to showcase the MK and tell the Nouns DAO story.\\nSummary Plan\\nHere is a simple cost breakdown. A more detailed breakdown is below:\\n75K to manufacture approximately 700 keycap sets, OR a maximum of 275 full keyboards OR some combination of the two depending on demand, while still meeting Minimum Order Quantity.\\n15K for assembling, packaging, storage, and decent-quality shipping.\\n29K for digital marketing and artisan keycap including low, medium, and high tiers.\\n35K for the team, MK designer, website, and fulfillment.\\nTotal - 154K USD\\nFAQs\\nWhat will the design be?\\nNOT THE ONE YOU SEE. That is just to spark the imagination, the designer will come up with something much more aesthetic and subtle once we go through the brief.\\nWho is the designer?\\nThey are one of the mentioned people below. Due to their high profile status in the MK community, they don't want to reveal their name until they see the support from Nouns and can begin working on it. I can assure you he is one of the best out there for this project.\\nWho is going to buy this?\\nIdeally NOT people in crypto. The point isn\\u2019t to sell it to Nouns holders, it's to distribute it to the MK community and proliferate the idea. That's also why we are working with a designer that the MK community respects.\\nHow much are the NFTs?\\nApproximately $120-130 USD for the keycap set and $350-380 USD for the full keyboard option. Noun holders can purchase for free (within the budgeted units in the grant) while non-Noun holders will pay full price. We aim to distribute these on popular vendor platforms to maximize reach!\\nHow does the redemption work?\\nOnce you redeem, the NFT becomes non-transferable. Because sharing pictures of the keyboard is important and having an NFT is even better.\\nHow are you going to sell to noncrypto people?\\nWe aim to work with traditional distribution channels such as marketplaces and communities to reach the MK community. We are exploring solutions for wallet creation for the consumer at the purchase stage.\\nWhy is it so expensive?\\nCustom mechanical keyboards by top-tier designers, with good quality switches, cases, and components can go around $500 USD. Given the interested designer and other components, this is a reasonable price.\\nHow many units?\\nThe free units for Noun holders would be Approximately 700 keycaps or 275 full keyboards or a combination that totals a maximum of 75k worth of manufacturing. We plan to sell more units for a profit to non-Nouns holders.\\nWill the keyboards be assembled?\\nWe have an assembled and un-assembled option for the minters since for some collectors assembling is part of the custom MK experience.\\nHow long does it take to deliver?\\nDesign could be done quickly but we want to give the designer 4-6 weeks. Manufacturing takes about 6-7 months. Delivery should take 2-4 weeks. So about 8 months, but assuming unforeseen challenges we are accounting for 9-10 months from the time funds have been received.\\nWhat happens to the grant and mint profits?\\nThe grant helps meet the Minimum Order Quantity for manufacturing which wouldn\\u2019t be possible otherwise. The profits from the non-Nouns holders go to the team which we expect to be less than 20K USD.\\nWill anything be returned to the Nouns DAO?\\nBecause we are MK enthusiasts we simply want this to become a reality, so we have made the team portion of the grant very modest relative to the work it takes. But we are committed to using some of the profits to buy a Noun and participate in the community - this also incentivized Nouns to help the success of the project. We don\\u2019t think it\\u2019s Nounish to be underpaid, make direct payments to the DAO, and leave.\\nHow big is the MK community?\\nThe forums and discord servers of designers are similar to or, bigger in size and activity compared to crypto communities. It is pretty scattered online, but I have made a\\nspreadsheet here\\nto provide some context.\\nHow will the project continue besides a one-off product?\\nWe will plan an extension if this grant proves to be successful. It would involve creating a subDAO and experimenting with various products.\\nDetailed Plan\\nCustom keyboard manufacturing involves two main components: the case and the keycap set. Switches and other components are also significant, but they are less customizable; therefore, we will simply use ones considered enthusiast grade. For a more detailed overview of mechanical keyboards,\\ncheck out this intro made by NextMech\\n.\\nDesign -\\nTo start, we will incorporate the Nouns brand into the keyboard canvas. We have talked to several designers who can create an aesthetic Noun-themed keyboard. These include\\nBIIP\\n,\\nNoPunIn10Did\\n,\\nsourmk\\n, pikku-allu, dededecline who would be able to capture the essence of the Nouns in a design. Also, a design by a top artist plays a major role in introducing Nouns to the MK community, ensuring a high-quality product that enthusiasts will enjoy. Here are some examples by the mentioned designers:\\n[BIIP Dots]\\n[Pikku Allu Symbiote]\\n[Sourmk Dandy]\\nManufacturing -\\nWe will work with a manufacturer with double-shot ABS capability to be able to make high-quality keycaps. However, if the creative direction requires a custom font we may trade off double-shot quality for printing flexibility. As for the case, we will be using an available unit from existing manufacturer catalogs that matches the keycaps set. The remaining components will be wholesale units that are considered enthusiast-grade quality.\\nThe NFT -\\nwill include the custom design once the prototypes are finalized. Mint of keycaps will be priced at approximately $120-130 USD, while the full keyboard (including the keycaps) will be $350-380 USD. It will have boolean-based redemption on\\nnouns.mk\\nsince we don't want to burn the NFT and instead share it online. We also aim to work with traditional distributors to be able to reach the MK community.\\nMarketing -\\nPrior to, and during the minting of the Keyboard NFTs, we will launch digital and physical marketing efforts to increase the visibility of the project. The physical marketing is in the style of MK communities. We are considering 3 different types of artisan keycaps. The keycaps are, Resin filled 3D keycaps that could have Nouns characters or traits inside, high-quality metallic keycaps, and Plastic keycaps with Nouns related graphics that can be given away for free at crypto conferences and MK events, or for a low cost online.\\nHere are examples of existing Resin and metallic keycaps by artisans. They will be designed and produced in a Nouns related theme. These caps can be a great addition to the custom keyboard, or they allow MK enthusiasts to add it to their existing keyboards.\\nDelivery -\\nOnce manufacturing, assembly, and quality tests are complete, the NFTs can be redeemed. They will be stored with a distributor or manufacturer and can be redeemed at any time. It is possible to sell the NFTs prior to redeeming them with a 5% royalty fee.\\nCurrent Progress\\nWe will keep up-to-date information and progress on our Notions page. Here are some highlights from the current progress:\\nDetermined feasible manufacturers for case and keycaps.\\nDiscussing terms with keycap set designer and singular keycap manufacturers.\\nRegistered\\nNouns.mk\\ndomain, Twitter/X\\n@nounsmk\\n,\\u00a0ENS\\nnounsmk.eth\\n,\\u00a0and nounsmkdao.eth for marketing.\\nUpdated budget and design constraints from previous proposal attempts.\\nTeam\\nProfish\\n: My past experience is creating wallets and automation a crypto trading companies and cadCAD tokenomics.

We should expand this to the core  Nouns artwork with an experimental open edition that allows fans and Nouns-curious folks to build their own Noun. This could be a fun Droposal event that onboards many new Nouns players via a fun, experimental, yet meaningful, open edition.

It adapts to the evolving narrative of community-led efforts within Nouns DAO, offering a dynamic platform for Noun holders to personalize their governance journey.\\nWhy Atenea?\\nAtenea is more than a governance client\\u2014it's a canvas for Nouners to craft their governance masterpiece. It's about turning governance from a duty into an experience.\\nShape your governance. Shape your world. Make it Nounish.\\nOur Journey for the Past 4 Months\\nSome months ago, navigating on-chain proposals seemed complex. We saw each DAO member needing a unique solution due to the decentralized and varied nature of our system. So, we aimed for a solution offering freedom\\u2014a system to explore governance without limits. With a clear vision, we began to color our sketch.\\nFun and Creativity\\n:  We built a widget system for customization. Like a canvas to an artist, Atenea aims to spark curiosity in Nouns governance.\\nAgility\\n: We designed all elements to be flexible and self-adjustable, aiming for a smooth user experience.\\nInformative\\n: We created a database to include all necessary information for a Nouner, avoiding the loss of crucial data. Atenea, named after a Greek goddess symbolizing wisdom, reflects our mission for an informed community.\\nUseful and Analytical\\n: Atenea aims to provide insights from social to economic aspects within DAO, all easily accessible, valuing Nouners' time while enhancing their experience.\\nCurrent Widgets from Atenea\\nWe have spent most of our time building the structure of the Atenea, live saving, sharable clients, remix clients, accounts, etc. Even so, we have created 15 widgets with which you can explore governance starting today:\\nProposal Overview\\nActive Proposals\\nProposals Funded by Category\\nExecuted Proposals\\nNoun of the day\\nNouners Feedback\\nRoadmap\\nStats\\nFunded Teams\\nProposal Team\\nTreasury\\nWhat Makes Atenea Unique?\\nThe 'network effect' within Nouns is special\\u2014it\\u2019s about many joining forces for something larger. We envisioned an open system where any coder could create widgets, with imagination being the only limit. This collective effort will birth something unique.\\nAtenea removes the entry barriers to client development to make Nouns governance more exciting. Choose which part of the governance you want to improve and, we will make it as easy as possible for you.\\nROADMAP\\nHigh-Priority\\nRoll out features like bidding, making proposals, candidate functions, assimilating updates.wtf, and proposal voting.\\nIntegration of external data sources, such as updates.wtf, would require the development of API connectors or data import tools. This ensures that Atenea keeps up to date with information from these data sources. (We have already completed it)\\nImplementing interaction with smart contracts would involve creating and designing the user experience (UX) for interacting with them, with a strong focus on maximum security.\\nThe proposal creation system is currently our top priority. It allows users to create proposals directly from Atenea, including all necessary data such as category, budget, roadmap or team, all accessible through Atenea widgets. In addition, all the information in these proposals would be accessible through the API for anyone to use.\\nMid-Priority\\nOptimize data processing and improve the open-source widget creation system.\\nAtenea will only make sense if it works in public, so articles (for propdates) will be made announcing the progress (2 times a month) and a monthly video talking about the most important aspects in which progress has been made in the period.\\nTEAM\\nJosep: Product, UI and Community.\\nI'm a senior student majoring in mathematics and business with a strong passion for product development.

Nouns had historically limited market availability, however there are indications that nouns are in demand; for example, Noun8 was sold for 49 ETH.

With or without v3, it's more important token-holders stay than that they come in the first place.\\nThus\\nRather than be focused on protecting price/bv, we could instead prioritize minimizing forks, not just when auction prices are low but high as well. The two objectives are likely at odds in the long term. The dao has already proved that it will de-circulate Nouns if it serves near-term capital interests. Attempting to peg auction price to treasury balance via a periodic burn does not fundamentally change this.\\nBecause\\nAs long as natural demand is falling (price<bv), the highest marginal buyer at auction is still likely to be a value extractor. This is self-evident when fork threshold < allowed burn frequency, but is also the case generally. There is no way to eliminate the arb under this market condition via burn, meaning there can be be little/no supply expansion under price contraction.\\nAnd\\nWhen periods of price & supply expansion (price>bv) reverse, the dao will be under significant & possible cascading exit pressure in the form of profit-taking. We may find the token supply ultimately little changed. Nouns lifers will be palliated by an increased voting share in the dao (as with fork # 0), rather than rightfully held to task for failing to value progressive decentralization, inclusivity and organic leadership churn.\\nAnd So\\nI suggest we encode the recirculation of treasury nouns at a predictable cadence after forks (N/year until fully distributed).\\nFork execution schedules a series of on-chain prop house-style rounds (perhaps triggered by a modified auction settlement process?) where anyone can apply to be granted a Noun via a weighted vote governed by Noun-owners. Imo the most visceral/memetic steady-state value for N is 365. We can ramp up responsibly but lets not take an eternity.\\nThis maximizes alignment on growing the Nouns holder base, rather than near-term auction demand, minimizes arb interest and downstream rugs. It affords ardent Nouns believers a direct, merit-based pathway to agency in the network, and demonstrates we are immutably committed to a diverse and expanding range of interesting voices contributing to the conversation- the highest good for us, Ethereum, and beyond.\\nNouns belong to the world.\",\n",

Therefore, I reconsidered two aspects:\\nThe amount of ETH will decrease from 10 ETH to 6.5 ETH for the same quantity of GIFs.\\nThe other point revolved around the other \\\"nounish\\\" GIFs. Further down in this proposal, I will detail why GIFs featuring nouns as protagonists are very important and complement those.\\nAlso onizuka.eth asked About Distribution:\\nAll the GIFs will be part of a Giphy collection in an account called 'Nouns GIFs.' Each GIF will include the 'What is Nouns DAO' video as the source. This way, every person who receives the GIF will be able to learn more about that character.\\nOf course, every piece of creation, including my 3D models, will be  CC0 and shared with the community. This means that in the future, if we want to turn the GIFs into collectible NFTs, we will be able to do so.\\nEvery GIF will be shared with the Nouns Twitter account manager for distribution to the community.\\nAll 100 GIFs and files will be stored in a folder accessible to the community at any time.\\nDescription\\nI would like to share the proposal I have been working on, as I believe it could greatly benefit the proliferation of our beloved\\nNouns\\n, something we all cherish in this community.\\nThe proposal I have in mind is\\nsimple\\nyet\\npowerful\\n: I want to create a large number of\\n2D\\nand\\n3D\\ngifs and stickers featuring Nouns characters. These gifs and stickers will be communicative, humorous and\\nrelatable\\nwith the aim of reaching a wider audience with Nouns characters and encouraging their recurring use.\\nGoal\\nThe goal is to make GIFs that people both inside and outside the world of nouns can use. This way, they'll start incorporating nouns into their\\ndaily lives\\n. Plus, GIFs are currently one of the most viral forms of content because their primary purpose is to be shared to convey an idea, emotion, or joke.\\nPudgy Penguins\\nA successful case we can take as a reference is  \\\"Pudgy Penguins\\\" Gif collection. With just a few months of gif publications, the Pudgies reached many new people and quickly became popular.\\nAnother important aspect is that producing gifs is more cost-effective than producing videos, and unlike videos, the gifs we create today can be used indefinitely.\\nNounish Gifs\\nCurrently, the Nounish team is crafting some  cool GIFs for nouns. It's a clever strategy to enhance familiar images by adding the noggles on top of them. However, most regular folks probably don't know what these \\\"noggles\\\" are. That's why these GIFs introduce the characters behind the \\\"noggles\\\" brand. These will complement the current ones beautifully!\\nCharacter GIFs are very useful for a brand because users become more attached to the characters and what they represent with each passing day. Currently, neither the community nor individuals outside it have the opportunity to use small nouns to communicate, as the Pudgy Penguins community does. This proposal aims to address that need.\\nTeam\\nTo carry out this proposal, I'll be teaming up with my friend and colleague Santiago Pereyra. He will handle the 2D animations while I will take care of the 3D animations. Below, I've included some samples of our work:\\n3D: Created by me. 2D:Created by my friend and coworker santiago.\\nAnimation For lil Nouns.\\nI have also created animations for Lil Nouns (I plan to make more and test them on social media).\\nYou can see them right here ( SOUND ON):\\nAnim1\\nAnim2\\nAnim3\\nAlso i am finishing a little shortfilm for Nouns Amigos:  Here is a really rough cut, without sound, details, I show it anyways but this is far to be finished:\\nSample\\nTo sum it up, I have been creating content for nouns for a while, and I would love to double down on this effort and create the best possible Nouns GIF collection\\nI think that the best way is to start small and then if the dao wants we can keep doing more so i will make a prop asking for : 6.5 ETH\\nDETAILS\\nTime to produce each GIF: 4-6 hours.\\nCost per hour:\\n$40.\\nCost per GIF: $160\\n- $240.\\nTOTAL\\nfor 100 GIFS\\n: $16000 - $24000.\\nAs we are making a big batch, we can easily round it to $16000, which is approximately\\n10 ETH.\\n(Some Nouns said that the ask is to big, so it will be 6.5 ETH)\\nThank you VERY MUCH for Reading the entire PROP!\",\n",

This change will also mitigate the “risk free value” arbitrage (detailed below). When this change is first introduced, there should be a waiting period before the first burn can occur, in order to give the DAO time to coordinate.
